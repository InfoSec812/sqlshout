SQLshout is a shoutcast compatible streaming source application which uses a MySQL database for playlist management.
The application is designed to be used in conjunction with a PHP Nuke module such that web site users can request
songs, vote on songs, and the admin can manage the playlist queue.

If you want to help debug the code, set the environment variable CPPFLAGS before running configure and run configure 
as follows:

In BASH

export CPPFLAGS="-DDEBUG"
./configure --enable-debug <other options>

In CSH

set CPPFLAGS="-DDEBUG"
./configure --enable-debug <other options>

The -DDEBUG flag will turn on lots of extra debugging messages, so you may want to redirect STDERR to a text file.

To install the PHPNuke module and add the table defs to the database:

cd nuke/
./install_nuke_mods.sh

You will be prompted for various information about your setup, and a sqlshout config file will be generated.

Enjoy!!!
